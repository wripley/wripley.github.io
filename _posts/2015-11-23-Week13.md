title: "OOP Week 13"
---
Thirteen weeks complete, and we have finished the final project for OOP! Huzzah. It is exciting to look back on all the projects that we have completed, and I appreciate all of the overhead details. by overhead details, I mean documentation, issue tracking, unit testing, and acceptance testing. After writing 144 tests for project 5 with my partner, I am not in the mood to write tests for a little while. However, I realize that these things are important, and in the little experience I have had working in my internship last summer, I began my appreciation of writing code, UI, and documentation which makes software easy to use and develop for, not a mess to find the problems with. Designing a strong object model can sometimes be a tough challenge. I am taking Graphics as the same time as OOP, and I am confident that some of the code I wrote for that class would give the TAs and Downing nightmares, but I also know my coding in OOP is only the beginning of better design. The things we learned this week, virtual methods and abstract methods in C++, are simply another branch of enforcing a strong and unified design. On top of this, I am excited to learn more about reflection. The day before we talked about reflection, I had heard the term as I was working on some coding, but I did not look much into it. Coincidentally, I have run into this term again so quickly.

Tip of the week: http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Microsoft-Retools-Minecraft-to-Teach-Kids-to-Code-82767.html

One of my other classes requires time looking at tech articles of any sort, and I found this one about Microsoftâ€™s Code.org project: a minecraft-themed introduction to coding for kids. I looked up the game on Code.org after seeing the article, and it sounds awesome that kids six and older can learn coding from a game they are familiar with.
